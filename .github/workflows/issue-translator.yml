                  CUSTOM_BOT_NOTE: "Bot detected the issue body's language is not English, translating it automatically. 👯👭🏻🧑‍🤝‍🧑👫🧑🏿‍🤝‍🧑🏻👩🏾‍🤝‍👨🏿👬🏿\n\n@${author}, if possible, please edit the original issue body or post a comment about this issue in english. While there are auto translation tools out there, important information, especially technical details are often lost when they are utilized. It is okay if you are not confident in English! We do however prefer imperfect English over machine translated English if possible."
